# Human Breast Cell Atlas

The adult human breast comprises of an intricate network of epithelial ducts and lobules that are embedded in connective and fatty tissues.  While previous studies have focused mainly on epithelial cells, other stromal, adipose and immune cell types remain understudied.  The Human Breast Atlas is a comprehensive unbiased using single cell and spatial genomic technologies to profile 248,687 cells from the breast tissues of 60 women, in addition to 89,301 nuclei from 20 women.  From these data 10 major cell types and 32 cell states with different biological functions were defined and organized into 4 spatial domains (adipose, fibrous connective, ducts, lobules).  Collectively, these data provide an unprecedented atlas of the normal cell types and cell states in the human breast, that will serve as an important reference for studying breast biology, development and diseases such as breast cancer.
