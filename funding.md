[Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/human-cell-atlas/the-human-breast-cell-atlas/)  

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative was founded in 2015 to help solve some of society’s toughest challenges — from eradicating disease and improving education, to addressing the needs of our local communities. The mission is to build a more inclusive, just, and healthy future for everyone. 

[Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/)

The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) is an international group of researchers which seeks to project that use a combination of recent single cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies to create cellular reference maps for all tissues in the human body. Ideally, these reference maps will eventially include position, function and characteristics of every cell type in the human body.

## Human Breast Cell Atlas Project

Our project was for a Human Breast Cell Atlas was funded in 2017. The Seed project focused on  establishing technical conditions for isolating and classifying cell types in normal breast tissue to recommend best practices. The expanded project was funded in 2019 to establish a comprehensive reference of cell types and cell states in human breast tissue with single cell and spatial resolution.

For more Behind the Scenes of the Human Breast Cell Atlas Project are detailed in an article by Renée van Amerongen.
